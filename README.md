# PyOs
run by python3 main.py, the other stuff uses this syntax, so you should make sure you have python3
nautilus is the default file browser, but if you don't have it, it asks for the technical name, so like nemo or pcmanfm or explorer.exe, though this is made to work on linux.
web browser opens the default browser, in a new window if possible, brave-browser doesn't let you do that, but chromium does
make sure you have PyOs in <your home path>/PyOs so you don't see your regular files, also so you don't f**k up your system

Go to PyOs 2.0 for better stuff
